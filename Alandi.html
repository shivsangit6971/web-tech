    			Alandi is a well known place of pilgrimage for Hindu Marathi people because of the town's association with Dnyaneshwar. His devotees believe that he is still alive.[15][16][17] A temple complex was built at Dnyaneshwar's samadhi and is visited by pilgrims, especially those of the Varkari sect. The Ekadashi of the dark half of each month attracts 60â€“70 thousand pilgrims to the town.[18]
